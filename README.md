# Ross-Lloyd---Perception-Writeup

Main writeup document is in folder RoboND_Perception_Project_Writeup - Ross Lloyd/AAMAIN.

All required python scripts and the output yaml files are in the main directory of the repo.

All inline images function correctly when viewed via the github site, on Windows 10 and using google chrome. Viewing within Ubuntu 16.04 may lead to pictures not displating correctly (tested with Firefox). Please note that directory structure must be preserved for images to display.
